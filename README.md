# Climate Data Scraping Project

## Project Concept

This project aims to develop a system for extracting, transforming, and storing historical climate data using web scraping techniques. The concept involves creating a Python application that automatically captures meteorological information from public web sources (primarily timeanddate.com), processes it, and stores it in a relational database for subsequent analysis and querying.

> **Note:** This project is currently in the planning/conceptual phase. Implementation has not yet begun.

## Proposed Features

- **Automated Web Scraping**: Extract climate data including temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure
- **Data Storage**: Design an optimized relational schema for temporal queries
- **Historical Analysis**: Implement analytical queries on collected climate data
- **Data Visualization**: Generate climate trend graphs and reports

## Planned Technology Stack

- **Python 3.x**: Main programming language
- **BeautifulSoup4**: For web data scraping
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database management
- **SQLite**: Lightweight relational database system
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization and trend analysis
